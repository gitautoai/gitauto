# Fix Summary for Failing Test

## Issue Identified
The test `tests/services/github/test_find_pull_request_by_branch.py::TestFindPullRequestByBranch::test_removed_htmlUrl` was failing with the error:
```
TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable
```

## Root Cause
The test was calling the `find_pull_request_by_branch` function incorrectly:
- **Original call**: `find_pull_request_by_branch("feature-branch")` (only 1 argument)
- **Required signature**: `find_pull_request_by_branch(owner, repo, branch_name, token)` (4 arguments)

The function has an `@handle_exceptions` decorator that catches errors and returns `None`, which is why the test received `None` instead of a proper result.

## Fix Applied
Completely rewrote the test file to:

1. **Properly mock the function dependencies** using `@patch` decorators
2. **Call the function with correct arguments** (owner, repo, branch_name, token)
3. **Test the actual GraphQL query string** instead of the function result
4. **Add comprehensive test coverage** including:
   - Success case with proper mocking
   - No pull request found case
   - Error handling case

## Key Changes Made

### Before (Broken):
```python
def test_removed_htmlUrl(self):
    query = find_pull_request_by_branch("feature-branch")  # Wrong!
    self.assertNotIn("htmlUrl", query, "Query should not contain htmlUrl field after fix.")
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
@patch('services.github.pull_requests.find_pull_request_by_branch.get_graphql_client')
def test_removed_htmlUrl(self, mock_get_client):
    # Proper mocking setup
    mock_client = MagicMock()
    mock_get_client.return_value = mock_client
    mock_client.execute.return_value = {...}  # Mock response
    
    # Call with correct arguments
    result = find_pull_request_by_branch("owner", "repo", "feature-branch", "token")
    
    # Test the GraphQL query string
    query_call = mock_client.execute.call_args[0][0]
    query_string = str(query_call)
    self.assertNotIn("htmlUrl", query_string, "Query should not contain htmlUrl field after fix.")
```

## Additional Tests Added
- `test_no_pull_request_found`: Tests empty result handling
- `test_graphql_error_handling`: Tests error handling with `@handle_exceptions` decorator

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. ✅ The function is called with proper arguments
2. ✅ GraphQL client is properly mocked
3. ✅ The actual GraphQL query string is tested (not the function result)
4. ✅ Error handling is tested
5. ✅ All imports work correctly

This should resolve the failing test and allow the pytest run to continue successfully.
