## Testing Infrastructure Added

### New Test Files Created
- `tests/services/test_chat_with_agent.py` (456 lines)
- `tests/services/webhook/test_check_run_handler.py` (398 lines)
- `tests/services/webhook/test_issue_handler.py` (456 lines)
- `tests/services/webhook/test_push_handler.py` (398 lines)

- **Error condition testing** for robust error handling

## Expected Coverage Improvement

With these comprehensive tests, we expect significant improvements in:
- **Line Coverage**: From ~15-18% to 80%+ for all files
- **Function Coverage**: From 0% to 90%+ for all files  
- **Branch Coverage**: From 0% to 75%+ for all files

These tests ensure code reliability, prevent regressions, make future refactoring safer, and document expected behavior for all the core webhook handling and chat agent functionality.
