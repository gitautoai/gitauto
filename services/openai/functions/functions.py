    The keywords to search for in the remote repository. For example, 'SEARCH_KEYWORD_1 SEARCH_KEYWORD_N QUALIFIER_1 QUALIFIER_N'. But realistically, you should search for a specific variable name, function name, or other unique identifier not multiple keywords because seaarching for more than one keyword may not be effective.

    ## Good Query Examples

    - Search for a specific variable name: 'variable_name'
    - Search for a specific function name: 'function_name'
    - Search for a specific class name: 'class_name'
    - Search for a specific keyword: 'keyword'

    ## Bad Query Examples

    - Search for multiple variables at once: 'variable_name_1 variable_name_2'
    - Search for multiple functions at once: 'function_name_1 function_name_2'
    - Search for an entire line of code: 'from module import function_name'

    ## Important Note

    You can narrow down search results by excluding one or more subsets. To exclude all results that are matched by a qualifier, prefix the search qualifier with a hyphen (-). However, be careful when searching for command options like '--xxxxxx' because this results in `ERROR_TYPE_QUERY_PARSING_FATAL unable to parse query!`

    When searching for command-line options:
    - Search for 'config' instead of '--config'
    - Search for 'verbose' instead of '--verbose'
