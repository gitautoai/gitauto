# This file is intentionally left empty to avoid pytest collection conflicts
# The actual tests are in client_test.py (following Go-style naming convention)
# 
# This file should not contain any test functions as it conflicts with

# All stripe client tests are located in:
# - client_test.py (unit tests)
# - client_integration_test.py (integration tests)
