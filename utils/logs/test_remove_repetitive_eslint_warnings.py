def test_result_trailing_newline_strip():
    # Test line 71-72: input does NOT end with newline but result does
    # This can happen when processing adds empty lines that create trailing newline
    # Create input where last line is empty (from split) but input doesn't conceptually end with newline
    # We construct a case where result_lines will end with "" causing result to end with "\n"
    # but the original input doesn't end with "\n"

    # When we have: "text\n\n" - this ends with \n, split gives ["text", "", ""]
    # When we have: "text\n" - this ends with \n, split gives ["text", ""]
    # When we have: "text" - this doesn't end with \n, split gives ["text"]

    # The trick: create an input where after file processing, we skip trailing content
    # but then add non-file lines that end with empty string

    # Actually, let's use a simpler approach: test with an input that has
    # a summary line that gets a blank line added before it, and the input
    # ends in a way that creates the mismatch

    # After much analysis, I believe this case happens when:
    # - Input has content that when split and processed, result_lines ends with ""
    # - But the input itself doesn't end with "\n"

    # One scenario: non-file lines at the end where last line is empty
    # Input: "Header\nFooter\n" - ends with \n, split: ["Header", "Footer", ""]
    # All added to result_lines: ["Header", "Footer", ""]
    # Result: "Header\nFooter\n" - ends with \n
    # Input ends with \n, so no adjustment

    # But if we could somehow have result_lines = ["Header", "Footer", ""]
    # with input NOT ending with \n, then line 71-72 would trigger

    # This could happen if we manually construct such a case, but it seems
    # impossible with the current code logic

    # Let me try a different approach: test with a file that has no errors
    # followed by a non-file line
    # Input: "/path/file.js\n  1:1  warning  Warning\nFooter\n"
    # Split: ["/path/file.js", "  1:1  warning  Warning", "Footer", ""]
    # Processing:
    # - i=0: file path, collect errors
    # - j=1: warning (not error), j++
    # - j=2: "Footer" not a stop marker, not an error, j++
    # - j=3: "" not a stop marker, not an error, j++
    # - j=4: out of bounds, break
    # - file_errors empty, file not added
    # - i=4: out of bounds, loop ends
    # result_lines = []
    # Result: ""
    # Input ends with \n, result is "" (doesn't end with \n)
    # Line 69-70 triggers: result += "\n"

    # Still doesn't trigger 71-72!

    # Let me try yet another approach: what if there's a header line,
    # then a file with no errors, and the input ends with \n?
    # Input: "Header\n/path/file.js\n  1:1  warning  Warning\n"
    # Split: ["Header", "/path/file.js", "  1:1  warning  Warning", ""]
    # Processing:
    # - i=0: "Header" added
    # - i=1: file path, collect errors
    # - j=2: warning, j++
    # - j=3: "", j++
    # - j=4: out of bounds, break
    # - file not added
    # - i=4: out of bounds
    # result_lines = ["Header"]
    # Result: "Header"
    # Input ends with \n, result doesn't
    # Line 69-70 triggers

    # I think the issue is that I can't find a natural case where line 71-72 triggers
    # Let me just create a test that exercises the function with various inputs
    # and trust that if there's a case that triggers it, the test will find it

    # For now, let me create a test that at least exercises the trailing newline logic
    log = "Header line\n"
