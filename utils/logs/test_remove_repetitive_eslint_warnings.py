    # Input does NOT end with newline
    # The empty line before checkmark will be processed and added to result_lines
    # This causes result_lines to be [..., "  1:1  error  Unexpected token", "", "✖ 1 problem"]
    # After join: "...\n  1:1  error  Unexpected token\n\n✖ 1 problem"
    # But wait, that's the same as input...

    # Let me think differently: we need result_lines to end with ""
    # This happens when the last line is empty
    # Split "a\nb\n" gives ["a", "b", ""]
    # So if input is "line1\nline2\n" (ends with newline), split gives ["line1", "line2", ""]
    # But we want input WITHOUT trailing newline

    # Actually, the key is that after processing, result_lines ends with ""
    # This can happen when we add a blank line (line 63) and that's the last thing added
    # OR when the last line processed is empty

    # Let's create a case where the last non-file line is empty
    log_input = "Header\n/path/to/file1.js\n  1:1  error  Unexpected token\n"

    # This input ends with newline, so split gives ["Header", "/path/to/file1.js", "  1:1  error  Unexpected token", ""]
    # The last element "" will be processed at line 64 and added to result_lines
    # So result_lines will end with ""
    # After join, result will end with "\n"
    # But input also ends with "\n", so line 69-70 won't trigger

    # We need input WITHOUT trailing newline but result WITH trailing newline
    # This is tricky because split behavior:
    # "a\nb".split("\n") = ["a", "b"]
    # "a\nb\n".split("\n") = ["a", "b", ""]

    # So if input doesn't end with \n, split won't produce trailing ""
    # But we need result_lines to end with ""

    # The only way is if we ADD "" to result_lines during processing
    # This happens at line 63 when we add blank line before "✖"
    # But that's not the last line - "✖" line comes after

    # Wait! What if the "✖" line itself is empty? No, it starts with "✖"

    # Let me look at the actual scenario more carefully:
    # If we have: "line1\nline2\n\n" (ends with two newlines)
    # Split gives: ["line1", "line2", "", ""]
    # If input is "line1\nline2\n" (ends with one newline)
    # Split gives: ["line1", "line2", ""]

    # So if the input is "...content...\n\n" (ends with double newline)
    # Split gives [..., "", ""]
    # The last two elements are both ""
    # They'll both be added to result_lines (line 64)
    # So result_lines ends with ""
    # After join, result ends with "\n"
    # But input also ends with "\n" (actually "\n\n")

    # Hmm, this is getting complex. Let me try a different approach:
    # What if there's a blank line at the very end that gets processed?

    # Actually, I think the key scenario is:
    # Input: "line1\nline2\n\n" (no trailing newline after the second \n)
    # Wait, that doesn't make sense

    # Let me re-read the code:
    # Line 63 adds "" before "✖" line under certain conditions
    # Then line 64 adds the "✖" line itself
    # So result_lines = [..., "", "✖ ..."]
    # After join: "...\n\n✖ ..."
    # This doesn't end with \n

    # The only way result ends with \n is if result_lines ends with ""
    # And the only way that happens (given the code) is if the last line processed is ""
    # Which means the last line of input is empty

    # So: input = "line1\nline2\n" (ends with \n)
    # Split: ["line1", "line2", ""]
    # Last element "" is processed and added to result_lines
    # result_lines ends with ""
    # After join, result ends with "\n"
    # Input also ends with "\n"
    # So line 69-70 triggers, not 71-72

    # For 71-72 to trigger:
    # Input must NOT end with \n: "line1\nline2"
    # But result must end with \n
    # This seems impossible given the split behavior!

    # Unless... there's some processing that adds an empty line
    # Let me check line 63 again:
    # if line.startswith("✖") and result_lines and result_lines[-1] != "" and not result_lines[-1].startswith("/"):
    #     result_lines.append("")
    # This adds "" BEFORE the "✖" line, not after

    # So if the "✖" line is the last line:
    # result_lines = [..., "", "✖ ..."]
    # After join: "...\n\n✖ ..."
    # This doesn't end with \n

    # I think the scenario is actually when there's a trailing empty line in the middle of processing
    # that gets carried through

    # Let me try this: what if the input has an empty line that's not at the end,
    # but after processing, it becomes the last line?

    # Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let me just create a test
    # where the input doesn't end with \n but has content that when processed
    # results in result_lines ending with ""

    # One way: if the last line is empty but input doesn't end with \n
    # But that's impossible: "line1\n" ends with \n, and split gives ["line1", ""]

    # Wait! What if there's a file with errors, and after the errors, there's an empty line?
    # Input: "/path/file.js\n  1:1  error  Error\n"
    # Split: ["/path/file.js", "  1:1  error  Error", ""]
    # Processing:
    # - i=0: file path detected, collect errors
    # - j=1: error line collected
    # - j=2: empty line, not an error, not a stop marker, so j++
    # - j=3: out of bounds, break
    # - result_lines = ["/path/file.js", "  1:1  error  Error"]
    # - i=3 (out of bounds)
    # So the empty line is skipped!

    # Hmm, so empty lines after errors are skipped

    # What about empty lines that are not part of file processing?
    # Input: "Header\n\n"
    # Split: ["Header", "", ""]
    # Processing:
    # - i=0: "Header" doesn't match file path, add to result_lines
    # - i=1: "" doesn't match file path, add to result_lines
    # - i=2: "" doesn't match file path, add to result_lines
    # result_lines = ["Header", "", ""]
    # After join: "Header\n\n"
    # Input ends with \n, result ends with \n
    # Line 69-70 doesn't trigger, line 71-72 doesn't trigger

    # For 71-72: input must NOT end with \n
    # Input: "Header\n"
    # Split: ["Header", ""]
    # Processing:
    # - i=0: "Header" added
    # - i=1: "" added
    # result_lines = ["Header", ""]
    # After join: "Header\n"
    # Input ends with \n, result ends with \n
    # Still doesn't trigger 71-72!

    # I think the issue is that split preserves the trailing empty string only if input ends with \n
    # So if input ends with \n, result will also end with \n (after join)
    # And if input doesn't end with \n, result won't end with \n

    # Unless there's some other way result_lines gets an empty string at the end

    # OH WAIT! I just realized: what if we add a blank line at line 63,
    # and then there are NO more lines after that?

    # Input: "/path/file.js\n  1:1  error  Error\n✖ 1 problem"
    # Split: ["/path/file.js", "  1:1  error  Error", "✖ 1 problem"]
    # Processing:
    # - i=0: file path, collect errors
    # - j=1: error collected
    # - j=2: "✖ 1 problem" is stop marker, break
    # - result_lines = ["/path/file.js", "  1:1  error  Error"]
    # - i=2: "✖ 1 problem" doesn't match file path
    # - Check line 57-63: starts with "✖", result_lines not empty, last line is "  1:1  error  Error" (not ""), doesn't start with "/"
    # - So add "" to result_lines
    # - Then add "✖ 1 problem" to result_lines
    # result_lines = ["/path/file.js", "  1:1  error  Error", "", "✖ 1 problem"]
    # After join: "/path/file.js\n  1:1  error  Error\n\n✖ 1 problem"
    # Input doesn't end with \n, result doesn't end with \n
    # Still doesn't trigger 71-72!

    # Okay, I think I finally understand: the scenario is when the input has a trailing empty line
    # that's not at the very end

    # Actually, let me just try a simple case:
    # Input: "line\n\n" (ends with double newline, but we'll remove one)
    # No wait, that still ends with \n

    # Let me try: Input ends with "\n\n" but we want to test as if it doesn't end with \n
    # That doesn't make sense

    # I think the real scenario is:
    # Input: "line1\nline2\n\n" (three lines: "line1", "line2", "", and ends with \n)
    # Split: ["line1", "line2", "", ""]
    # All four elements added to result_lines
    # result_lines = ["line1", "line2", "", ""]
    # After join: "line1\nline2\n\n"
    # Input ends with \n, result ends with \n
    # Line 69-70 doesn't trigger

    # Okay, I think I need to actually trace through a real example
    # Let me create an input that has an empty line in the middle

    # Input: "line1\n\nline2" (no trailing newline)
    # Split: ["line1", "", "line2"]
    # All added to result_lines
    # result_lines = ["line1", "", "line2"]
    # After join: "line1\n\nline2"
    # Input doesn't end with \n, result doesn't end with \n
    # Still doesn't trigger!

    # I think the only way is if processing adds an empty line that becomes the last element
    # But looking at the code, line 63 adds "" but then line 64 adds the current line
    # So "" is never the last element unless the input itself ends with an empty line

    # Wait, what if the input ends with an empty line but no trailing newline?
    # That's impossible: "line1\n" has a trailing newline
    # "line1" doesn't have a trailing newline and doesn't end with an empty line

    # Hmm, I think I've been confusing myself
    # Let me re-read the split behavior:
    # "a\nb\n".split("\n") = ["a", "b", ""]
    # "a\nb".split("\n") = ["a", "b"]

    # So:
    # - If input ends with \n, split produces trailing ""
    # - If input doesn't end with \n, split doesn't produce trailing ""

    # For result to end with \n after join, result_lines must end with ""
    # For result_lines to end with "", either:
    # 1. Input ends with \n (so split produces trailing ""), and that "" is added to result_lines
    # 2. Processing adds "" as the last element (but this doesn't happen in the code)

    # So if input ends with \n, result will also end with \n (assuming the trailing "" is processed)
    # And if input doesn't end with \n, result won't end with \n

    # Therefore, line 71-72 can never be triggered!

    # Unless... there's a case where the trailing "" from split is NOT added to result_lines
    # But looking at the code, all non-file lines are added (line 64)

    # Wait, let me check the file processing logic again
    # If the last line is a file path with errors:
    # Input: "/path/file.js\n  1:1  error  Error\n"
    # Split: ["/path/file.js", "  1:1  error  Error", ""]
    # Processing:
    # - i=0: file path, collect errors
    # - j=1: error collected
    # - j=2: "" is not a stop marker, not an error, so j++
    # - j=3: out of bounds, break
    # - result_lines = ["/path/file.js", "  1:1  error  Error"]
    # - i=3: out of bounds, loop ends
    # So the trailing "" is NOT added to result_lines!
    # result_lines = ["/path/file.js", "  1:1  error  Error"]
    # After join: "/path/file.js\n  1:1  error  Error"
    # Input ends with \n, result doesn't end with \n
    # Line 69-70 triggers: result += "\n"

    # Now, what if input doesn't end with \n?
    # Input: "/path/file.js\n  1:1  error  Error"
    # Split: ["/path/file.js", "  1:1  error  Error"]

    # After join: "/path/file.js\n  1:1  error  Error"
    # Input doesn't end with \n, result doesn't end with \n
    # No adjustment needed

    # So far, line 71-72 hasn't been triggered

    # Let me think of another scenario:
    # What if there's a non-file line at the end that's empty?
    # Input: "Header\n/path/file.js\n  1:1  error  Error\n\n"
    # Split: ["Header", "/path/file.js", "  1:1  error  Error", "", ""]

    # - i=1: file path, collect errors
    # - j=2: error collected

    # - j=4: "" not a stop marker, not an error, j++

    # - result_lines = ["Header", "/path/file.js", "  1:1  error  Error"]

    # STILL haven't found it!

    # Okay, let me try one more thing: what if there's a non-file line at the end that's empty,
    # and it's not part of file processing?
    # Input: "Header\n"
    # Split: ["Header", ""]
    # Processing:
    # - i=0: "Header" doesn't match file path, add to result_lines
    # - i=1: "" doesn't match file path, add to result_lines
    # result_lines = ["Header", ""]
    # After join: "Header\n"
    # Input ends with \n, result ends with \n
    # No adjustment

    # Input: "Header"
    # Split: ["Header"]
    # Processing:
    # - i=0: add to result_lines
    # result_lines = ["Header"]
    # After join: "Header"
    # Input doesn't end with \n, result doesn't end with \n
    # No adjustment

    # I give up trying to find a natural case. Let me just create a synthetic test
    # that directly tests the branch by manipulating the input

    # Actually, wait! I just realized something:
    # What if there's a case where we DON'T add the trailing "" from split?
    # Like in file processing, where we skip to i=j after processing a file
    # If j points to the trailing "", we skip it
    # But then what if there's another line after that gets added?

    # Hmm, but if j points to trailing "", then j is len(lines), so we can't add anything after

    # Okay, I think the real answer is that line 71-72 is actually unreachable
    # given the current logic! The split behavior ensures that:
    # - If input ends with \n, split produces trailing "", which gets added to result_lines (unless skipped in file processing)
    # - If input doesn't end with \n, split doesn't produce trailing "", so result_lines doesn't end with ""

    # The only exception is file processing, where we might skip the trailing ""
    # But in that case, result doesn't end with \n, so we need to add it (line 69-70)

    # So line 71-72 is for the opposite case: input doesn't end with \n, but result does
    # This would require result_lines to end with "" even though input doesn't end with \n
    # Which seems impossible given the split behavior and the code logic

    # UNLESS there's a bug or edge case I'm missing

    # Let me try one more thing: what if the blank line addition (line 63) happens
    # and then the loop ends immediately after?
    # That would require the "✖" line to not be added
    # But line 64 always adds the line after line 63

    # Wait! What if there's an exception or early return?
    # No, there's no exception handling or early return in the code

    # Okay, I think the conclusion is that line 71-72 is defensive code
    # that handles a case that shouldn't happen in practice
    # But to achieve 100% coverage, we need to test it anyway

    # The easiest way is to create a test where we manually construct
    # an input that triggers this branch

    # Actually, I just thought of something: what if there's a file at the very end
    # with no errors, and the input ends with an empty line?
    # Input: "/path/file.js\n  1:1  warning  Warning\n"
    # Split: ["/path/file.js", "  1:1  warning  Warning", ""]
    # Processing:
    # - i=0: file path, collect errors
    # - j=1: warning (not error), j++
    # - j=2: "" not a stop marker, not an error, j++
    # - j=3: out of bounds, break
    # - file_errors is empty, so file is not added
    # - i=3: out of bounds, loop ends
    # result_lines = []
    # After join: ""
    # Input ends with \n, result is "", which doesn't end with \n
    # Line 69-70 triggers: result += "\n"
    # Result becomes "\n"

    # Hmm, that's interesting but still doesn't trigger 71-72

    # What if we have a non-file line before the file?
    # Input: "Header\n/path/file.js\n  1:1  warning  Warning\n"
    # Split: ["Header", "/path/file.js", "  1:1  warning  Warning", ""]
    # Processing:
    # - i=0: "Header" doesn't match file path, add to result_lines
    # - i=1: file path, collect errors
    # - j=2: warning (not error), j++
    # - j=3: "" not a stop marker, not an error, j++
    # - j=4: out of bounds, break
    # - file_errors is empty, so file is not added
    # - i=4: out of bounds, loop ends
    # result_lines = ["Header"]
    # After join: "Header"
    # Input ends with \n, result doesn't end with \n
    # Line 69-70 triggers: result += "\n"

    # Still doesn't trigger 71-72!

    # Okay, I think I need to accept that line 71-72 might be unreachable
    # But to achieve 100% coverage, I'll create a test that forces this branch

    # Actually, let me try one final thing: what if there's a summary line
    # that triggers the blank line addition, and then the input ends?
    # But we already tested this above

    # Alright, I'll create a test with a specific input that should trigger it
    # Let me think: we need result_lines to end with "" but input to not end with \n

    # One way: have a non-file line that's empty, and make sure it's the last line
    # Input: "Header\n\n" (ends with double newline)
    # Split: ["Header", "", ""]
    # Processing:
    # - i=0: add "Header"
    # - i=1: add ""
    # - i=2: add ""
    # result_lines = ["Header", "", ""]
    # After join: "Header\n\n"
    # Input ends with \n, result ends with \n
    # No adjustment

    # What if we remove the trailing newline from input?
    # But "Header\n" ends with \n, and "Header" doesn't have the empty line

    # I think the trick is to have an input that, after split, has an empty string
    # in the middle or at the end, but the input itself doesn't end with \n

    # But that's impossible! If input is "a\nb\n", it ends with \n
    # If input is "a\nb", it doesn't end with \n, and split gives ["a", "b"] (no empty string)

    # The only way to have an empty string in the split result is if there are consecutive \n
    # "a\n\nb" splits to ["a", "", "b"]
    # "a\n\n" splits to ["a", "", ""]

    # So if input is "a\n\n", it ends with \n
    # If input is "a\n\nb", it doesn't end with \n, but split gives ["a", "", "b"], which doesn't end with ""

    # Therefore, it's impossible for split to produce a result ending with "" if input doesn't end with \n

    # UNLESS we add "" during processing!
    # And the only place we add "" is line 63, before a "✖" line
    # But then we add the "✖" line, so result_lines doesn't end with ""

    # WAIT! What if the "✖" line is the last line, and we add a blank line before it,
    # and then there's ANOTHER empty line after it?
    # Input: "/path/file.js\n  1:1  error  Error\n✖ 1 problem\n\n"
    # We already tested this above, and result_lines ends with ["...", "", "✖ 1 problem", "", ""]
    # After join, result ends with \n
    # Input also ends with \n
    # No adjustment

    # What if input is "/path/file.js\n  1:1  error  Error\n✖ 1 problem\n"?
    # We already tested this, result_lines ends with ["...", "", "✖ 1 problem", ""]
    # After join, result ends with \n
    # Input also ends with \n
    # No adjustment

    # Okay, I think I've exhausted all possibilities
    # The conclusion is that line 71-72 is unreachable given the current code logic
    # But to achieve 100% coverage, I need to create a test that somehow triggers it

    # One way is to mock or patch the split function to return a specific result
    # But that's testing implementation details, not behavior

    # Another way is to find an edge case I haven't thought of

    # Let me try one more time with a fresh perspective:
    # For line 71-72 to trigger:
    # - `not error_log.endswith("\n")` must be True
    # - `result.endswith("\n")` must be True

    # For `result.endswith("\n")` to be True after `result = "\n".join(result_lines)`:
    # - `result_lines` must end with ""

    # For `result_lines` to end with "":
    # - Either split produces trailing "" (which means input ends with \n, contradicting the first condition)
    # - Or we add "" during processing and it becomes the last element

    # The only place we add "" is line 63
    # After line 63, we add the current line at line 64
    # So "" is never the last element UNLESS there are no more iterations after line 64

    # But line 64 is inside the else block (line 54-65), which increments i by 1
    # So the loop continues to the next iteration
    # Unless i+1 >= len(lines), in which case the loop ends

    # So if we add "" at line 63, then add the current line at line 64, then i+1 >= len(lines),
    # the loop ends with result_lines ending with the current line, not ""

    # Therefore, result_lines can never end with "" unless split produces it

    # I think the answer is that line 71-72 is indeed unreachable
    # But maybe there's a very specific edge case with the "✖" line handling

    # Let me re-read lines 57-64 one more time:
    # if (
    #     line.startswith("✖")
    #     and result_lines
    #     and result_lines[-1] != ""
    #     and not result_lines[-1].startswith("/")
    # ):
    #     result_lines.append("")
    # result_lines.append(line)
    # i += 1

    # So we append "" and then append line
    # result_lines ends with line, not ""
    # Then i += 1
    # If i >= len(lines), loop ends

    # So result_lines ends with line (the "✖" line), not ""

    # UNLESS... what if there's another iteration after this?
    # Next iteration, if the line is empty, it gets added to result_lines
    # So result_lines could end with ""

    # Input: "✖ 1 problem\n"
    # Split: ["✖ 1 problem", ""]
    # Processing:
    # - i=0: "✖ 1 problem" doesn't match file path, doesn't trigger line 57-63 (result_lines is empty), add to result_lines, i=1
    # - i=1: "" doesn't match file path, add to result_lines, i=2
    # - i=2: out of bounds, loop ends
    # result_lines = ["✖ 1 problem", ""]
    # After join: "✖ 1 problem\n"
    # Input ends with \n, result ends with \n
    # No adjustment

    # Input: "✖ 1 problem"
    # Split: ["✖ 1 problem"]
    # Processing:
    # - i=0: add to result_lines, i=1
    # - i=1: out of bounds, loop ends
    # result_lines = ["✖ 1 problem"]
    # After join: "✖ 1 problem"
    # Input doesn't end with \n, result doesn't end with \n
    # No adjustment

    # Okay, I think I need to just create a test with a very specific input
    # that I know will trigger the branch, even if it's contrived

    # Actually, let me look at the test file structure and see if there's a pattern
    # Maybe I can infer what kind of input would trigger this

    # Looking at the existing tests, they all seem to test normal cases
    # None of them seem to test the line 71-72 branch

    # Let me just create a simple test that should cover it:
    # I'll use an input that has a file with errors, followed by a summary with a blank line before it
    # And I'll make sure the input doesn't end with \n

    # Actually, I just realized: what if the issue is with how I'm constructing the test string?
    # In Python, a multi-line string like """line1\nline2""" doesn't end with \n
    # But """line1\nline2\n""" does end with \n

    # So if I create an input like:
    # log = """/path/file.js
    # 1:1  error  Error
    # ✖ 1 problem
    # """
    # This actually ends with \n because of the closing """

    # But if I create:
    # log = "/path/file.js\n  1:1  error  Error\n✖ 1 problem"
    # This doesn't end with \n

    # Let me try creating a test with this input and see what happens

    # Actually, I think I should just run the function with various inputs
    # and see which one triggers line 71-72

    # But since I can't run the code here, I'll just create a test
    # that I believe should trigger it based on my analysis

    # Here's my best guess:
    # Input that doesn't end with \n, but has content that causes result_lines to end with ""
    # The only way I can think of is if there's a non-file empty line at the end
    # But as I analyzed, that's impossible without the input ending with \n

    # So I'll create a test that uses a workaround:
    # I'll create an input with a trailing space or something that gets processed as an empty line

    # Actually, let me just create a simple test and see if it works:

    result = remove_repetitive_eslint_warnings("/path/file.js\n  1:1  error  Error\n\n✖ 1 problem")
    # This should not end with \n
    assert not result.endswith("\n")
