DIFF_DESCRIPTION = """
A UNIFIED DIFF FORMAT with ZERO CONTEXT LINES like command `diff -U0` or `diff --unified=0`. This diff must specifically be in one of the following three formats: addition, modification, or deletion:

1. For existing files: First, try to modify existing files that match the intended functionality.

1-1. For modified files (Replace lines of code)

```diff(unified=0)
--- path/to/file1
+++ path/to/file1
@@ -5,1 +5,1 @@
- original line 5
+ modified line 5
```

1-2. For modified files (Remove lines of code)

```diff(unified=0)
--- path/to/file2
+++ path/to/file2
@@ -10,1 +10,0 @@
- original line 10
```

1-3. For modified files (Add lines of code)

```diff(unified=0)
--- path/to/file3
+++ path/to/file3
@@ -15,0 +15,1 @@
+ added line 15
```

1-4. For modified files (Remove markdown bullet points)

```diff(unified=0)
--- path/to/file4.md
+++ path/to/file4.md
@@ -20,3 +20,0 @@
- - First bullet point
- - Second bullet point
- - Third bullet point
```

2. For new files (IMPORTANT: Only create new files if no existing file can be modified to achieve the desired functionality. Never create files with temporary names or suffixes like 'style.css_mod1' or 'index.html_mod1')

```diff(unified=0)
--- /dev/null
+++ path/to/new/file
@@ -0,0 +1,3 @@
+ added line 1
+ added line 2
+ added line 3
```

3. For deleted Files

```diff(unified=0)
--- path/to/delete
+++ /dev/null
```

## Hunk header format rules

- A hunk represents where changes occur in a file.
- A hunk header should be in the following format: `@@ -start1,length1 +start2,length2 @@`.
- start1 and start2 denote the starting line number for the original and modified files, respectively.
- length1 and length2 denote the number of lines the change hunk applies to for each file.
- Hunk headers MUST order by start1 and start2 in ascending order.

## Line ending rules

- Line ending MUST be LF.

## Other rules about diff format

- NEVER EVER include any comments or explanations.
- NEVER EVER include any context lines around changed lines. ONLY include the changed lines.
- Each function call MUST generate exactly ONE hunk (one @@ header) for ONE change block.
