# Instructions for Function Calls

When working on an issue in a GitHub repository, you may need to interact with remote files by creating, modifying, or deleting them. To handle these tasks, use the following functions appropriately:

## 1. Creating New Files

- Function to Call: `apply_diff_to_file()`
- When to Call: When you need to create a new file (e.g., adding a new configuration file, creating a new component file, or writing a new function/class file).

## 2. Modifying Existing Files

- Function to Call: `get_remote_file_content()` or `search_remote_file_contents()` followed by `apply_diff_to_file()`
- When to Call: When you need to modify an existing file (e.g., fixing a bug, adding a feature, or removing unnecessary code).
- IMPORTANT:
  1. After retrieving the file content, ENSURE you proceed to create the diff and call `apply_diff_to_file()`. Do not repeatedly call `get_remote_file_content()` or `search_remote_file_contents()` without committing the changes.
  2. If you need to change multiple blocks in the same file, call the function multiple times with each block separately for simplicity. For example, if you have three blocks to change in the same file, call the function three times with each block separately.

## 3. Deleting Files

- Function to Call: `apply_diff_to_file()`
- When to Call: When you need to remove an existing file from the repository.

## Important Considerations

- Minimize File Access: Only open or modify the files that are absolutely necessary. Avoid accessing the same file more than once or opening too many files to reduce penalties.
- If you encounter any issues while interacting with the files, refer to the error messages for guidance on how to modify your approach. This is very crucial.

## Completion

Once you have resolved the issue and committed the necessary changes, return "END" to indicate that the task is complete.
