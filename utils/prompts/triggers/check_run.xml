  Fix failed tests by analyzing logs and addressing root causes.
  
  When you get stuck and can't solve the problem, simplify rather than making it more complex. It's better to create a simple solution that passes tests (even if something is missing) than to over-complicate and mess up the PR. Simple solutions that work have more value than complex solutions that fail.
